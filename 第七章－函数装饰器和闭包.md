# CHAPTER 7 Function decorators and closures 
# 第七章 函数装饰器和必包

*There’s been a number of complaints about the choice of the name “decorator” for this feature. The major one is that the name is not consistent with its use in the GoF book[1]. The name decorator probably owes more to its use in the compiler area — a syntax tree is walked and annotated.
— PEP 318 — Decorators for Functions and Methods*  

对于这个功能来说，有很多关于“装饰器”取名上的抱怨。最重要的一条就是名称和GoF真本书中所讲的不一致［注释1］。

[1]. That’s the 1995 “Design Patterns” book by the so-called Gang of Four.  

Function decorators let us “mark” functions in the source code to enhance their behavior is some way. This is powerful stuff, but mastering it requires understanding closures.  

函数装饰器让我们在源码中“标记”函数以便在某种程度上增强这些函数的行为。这东西很强大，但是精通它需要理解闭包。  

One of the newest reserved keywords in Python is `nonlocal`, introduced in Python 3.0. You can have a profitable life as a Python programmer without ever using it if you adhere to a strict regimen of class-centered object orientation. However, if you want to imple‐ ment your own function decorators, you must know closures inside out, and then the need for nonlocal becomes obvious.  

在Python中的最新保留关键字是在3.0版本中引入的`nonlocal`。

Aside from their application in decorators, closures are also essential for effective asyn‐ chronous programming with callbacks, and for coding in a functional style whenever it makes sense.  



The end goal of this chapter is to explain exactly how function decorators work, from the simplest registration decorators to the rather more complicated parametrized ones. However, before we reach that goal we need to cover:  

本章的最终目标是明明白白解释函数装饰器是如何工作的，从最简单的注册装饰器到

• How Python evaluates decorator syntax  
• How Python decides whether a variable is local  
• Why closures exist and how they work  
• What problem is solved by nonlocal  

- Python如何计算装饰器语法
- Python如何确定一个变量是否为本地变量
- 为什么会存在闭包，以及它们如何工作的
- 什么问题可以由nolocal来解决

With this grounding, we can tackle further decorator topics:  

有了这个基础，我们可以进一步深入的装饰器话题：  

• Implementing a well-behaved decorator  
• Interesting decorators in the standard library 
• Implementing a parametrized decorator  

- 实现一个良好行为的装饰器
- 标准库中装饰器的意义
- 实现一个参数化的装饰器

We start with a very basic introduction to decorators, and then proceed with the rest of the items listed here. 

我们从介绍非常简单的装饰器开始，然后继续此处列出的内容。  

## Decorators 101 装饰器基础
A decorator is a callable that takes another function as argument (the decorated func‐ tion) [2]. The decorator may perform some processing with the decorated function, and returns it or replaces it with another function or callable object.

装饰器是一个接受另外函数做为参数（被装饰的函数）的可调用对象［2］。装饰器可能会对被装饰器函数执行一些操作，然后返回它或者将其替换为另外的函数、抑或可调用对象。  

[2]: Python also supports class decorators. They are covered in Chapter 21.  
 注释［2］：Python还支持类装饰器。它们出现在第21章。  

In other words, assuming an existing decorator named decorate, this code:  

换句话说，假设存在一个名称为decorate的装饰器，即代码：  

```python
@decorate
def target():
    print('running target()')
```

Has the same effect as writing this:  
具有相同效果的代码可以这样编写：  

```python
def target():
    print('running target()')
    
target = decorate(target)
```

The end result is the same: at the end of either of these snippets, the target name does not necessarily refer to the original target function, but to whatever function is re‐ turned by `decorate(target)`.  

最终的结果是一样的：这些代码片段中其中一个的结尾，变量名`target`没有引用原始target的必要，而是由`decorate(target)`返回的任意函数。  

To confirm that the decorated function is replaced, see the console session in Example 7-1.  

要确认被装饰函数的替换，参见例子7－1中的控制台会话。  

*Example 7-1. A decorator usually replaces a function with a different one.*  
例子7-1. 装饰器通常把函数替换为另外一个函数。  

```python
>>> def deco(func):
...     def inner():
...			print('running inner()')
...     return inner #1
>>> @deco
... def target(): #2
...     print('running target()')
...
>>> target() #3
running inner()
>>> target #4
<function deco.<locals>.inner at 0x10063b598>
```

1:	deco returns its inner function object.  
deco返回其内部的函数对象。  

2: target is decorated by deco.  
taget被deco所装饰。  

3:	Invoking the decorated target actually runs inner. 
调用被装饰器target，而实际上执行的则是inner。  

4: Inspection reveals that target is a now a reference to inner.  
检查显示target现在是一个到inner的引用。  

Strictly speaking, decorators are just syntactic sugar. As we just saw, you can always simply call a decorator like any regular callable, passing another function. Sometimes that is actually convenient, especially when doing `metaprogramming` — changing pro‐ gram behavior at run-time.  

严格上来讲，装饰器只是语法糖而已。就像我们刚才看到的那样，你一直以来都可以把调用一个装饰器简化成任何一次普通的调用，传递另外的函数。有时候这样做实际上非常方便，特别是在执行`元编程`——在运行时改变程序的行为。  

To summarize: the first crucial fact about decorators is that they have the power to replace the decorated function with a different one. The second crucial fact is that they are executed immediately when a module is loaded. This is explained next.  

总结：关于装饰器的第一个重要因素是它们有能力使用不同的函数来替换被装饰器的函数。第二个重要的因素是它们在模块载入时就被立即执行了。这种情况在下面有所解释。  

## When Python executes decorators
## Python执行装饰器的时机
A key feature of decorators is that they run right after the decorated function is defined. That is usually at import time, i.e. when a module is loaded by Python. Consider registration.py in Example 7-2.  

装饰器的一个关键特征是它们在被装饰器函数被定义之后就可以正确的运行。这通常发生在导入时，比如，一个模块被Python载入时。思考例子7－2中的registration.py。  

*Example 7-2. The registration.py module*   
例子7－2。 registration.py模块。  

```python
registry = []


def register(func):
	  print('running register(%s)' % func) 
    registry.append(func)
	  return func


@register
def f1():
    print('running f1()')
  

@register
def f2():
    print('running f2()')
    

def f3():
    print('running f3()')


def main():
    print('running main()') 
    print('registry ->', registry) 
    f1()
    f2()
    f3()
    
if __name__=='__main__': 
    main()
```

1: registry will hold references to functions decorated by @register   
registry通过@register能够拥有被装饰函数的引用。  

2: register takes a function as argument.  
register将函数作为参数。  

3: Display what function is being decorated, for demonstration.  
说明什么函数正在被装饰。  

4: Include func in registry.  
在register内继承函数。  

5: Return func: we must return a function, here we return the same received as argument.  
返回func：我们必须返回一个函数，这里我们返回

6: f1 and f2 are decorated by @register.  
f1和f2由@register装饰。  

7: f3 is not decorated.  
f3未被装饰。  

8: `main` displays the registry, then calls `f1()`, `f2()` and `f3()`.  
`main`显示registry，然后调用`f1()`, `f2()` 和 `f3()`。  

9: `main()` is only invoked if registration.py runs as a script.  
如果registration.py当做脚本运行，那么`main()`是唯一被调用的。  

The output of running `registration.py` as a script looks like this:  

把`registration.py`当做脚本运行的输出结果如下：  

```shell
$ python3 registration.py
running register(<function f1 at 0x100631bf8>)
running register(<function f2 at 0x100631c80>)
running main()
registry -> [<function f1 at 0x100631bf8>, <function f2 at 0x100631c80>] running f1()
running f2()
running f3()
```

Note that `register` runs (twice) before any other function in the module. When reg ister is called, it receives as argument the function object being decorated, eg. `<func tion f1 at 0x100631bf8>`.  

注意`register`在模块中其他任意函数之前运行（了两次）。当`register`被调用时，

After the module is loaded, the `registry` holds references to the two decorated functions: `f1` and `f2`. These functions, as well as `f3`, are only executed when explicitly called by `main`.  

在模块载入之后，`registry`拥有对两个被装饰函数引用：f1` 和 `f2`。这些函数

If `registration.py` is imported (and not run as a script), the output is this:  

```python
>>> import registration
running register(<function f1 at 0x10063b1e0>) running register(<function f2 at 0x10063b268>)
```
At this time, if you look at the `registry`, here is what you get:

```python
>>> registration.registry
[<function f1 at 0x10063b1e0>, <function f2 at 0x10063b268>]
```


The main point of Example 7-2 is to emphasize that function decorators are executed as soon as the module is imported, but the decorated functions only run when they are explicitly invoked. This highlights the difference between what Pythonistas call `import time` and `run time`.  

Considering how decorators are commonly employed in real code, Example 7-2 is un‐ usual in two ways:  

• The decorator function is defined in the same module as the decorated functions. A real decorator is usually defined in one module and applied to functions in other modules.  
• The register decorator returns the same function passed as argument. In practice, most decorators define an inner function and return it.

Even though the register decorator in Example 7-2 returns the decorated function unchanged, that technique is not useless. Similar decorators are used in many Python Web frameworks to add functions to some central registry, for example, a registry map‐ ping URL patterns to functions that generate HTTP responses. Such registration dec‐ orators may or may not change the decorated function. The next section shows a prac‐ tical example.  

尽管例子7-2中的register装饰器返回的装饰函数并未改变，可实现技术也不是毫无用处。

## Decorator-enhanced Strategy pattern 
## 使用了装饰器的增强策略模式
A registration decorator is a good enhancement to the e-commerce promotional dis‐ count from “Case study: refactoring Strategy” on page 168.  

注册装饰器能够很好的改善在168页中的“案例探究：重构策略”的商业促销降价。  

Recall that our main issue with Example 6-6 is the repetition of the function names in their definitions and then in the promos list used by the `best_promo` function to determine the highest discount applicable. The repetition is problematic because someone may add a new promotional strategy function and forget to manually add it to the promos list — in which case `best_promo` will silently ignore the new strategy, introducing a subtle bug in the system. Example 6-8 solves this problem with a registration decorator.  

回想我们在例子6－6中遇到的主要问题是定义中的函数名称重复，在promos列表中使用`best_promo`来确定最高的降价额度。重复表明有问题存在，因为当用户添加了一个新的降价促销策略函数而且又忘记将该函数手动添加到promos列表，在这种情况下`best_promo`会不带任何提示地忽略新的策略，并在系统中留下一个不易察觉的错误。例子6-8利用注册装饰器解决了这个问题。  

*Example 7-3. The promos list is filled by the promotion decorator.*

```python
promos = []	＃1

def promotion(promo_func): ＃2
    promos.append(promo_func) 
    return promo_func

@promotion
def fidelity(order):	＃3
	 """5% discount for customers with 1000 or more fidelity points""" 
   return 	 order.total() * .05 if order.customer.fidelity >= 1000 else 0
	 
@promotion
def bulk_item(order):
	 """10% discount for each LineItem with 20 or more units""" discount = 0
	 for item in order.cart:
	 	 if item.quantity >= 20:
		 discount += item.total() * .1
		 return discount
		 
@promotion
def large_order(order):
	 """7% discount for orders with 10 or more distinct items""" distinct_items = 	 {item.product for item in order.cart}
	 if len(distinct_items) >= 10:
	 	  return order.total() * .07 return 0
	 	  
def best_promo(order):＃4
	 """Select best discount available"""
	 return max(promo(order) for promo in promos)
```

1：The promos list starts empty.  
promos开始是空的。  
2: promotion decorator returns promo_func unchanged, after adding it to the pro
mos list.  
3: Any function decorated by @promotion will be added to promos.  

4: No changes needed to best_promos, as it relies on the promos list


This solution has several advantages over the others presented in “Case study: refac‐ toring Strategy” on page 168:  
• The promotion strategy functions don’t have to use special names (like the _pro mo suffix).  
• The @promotion decorator highlights the purpose of the decorated function, and also makes it easy to temporarily disable a promotion: just comment out the dec‐ orator.  

• Promotional discount strategies may be defined in other modules, anywhere in the system, as long as the @promotion decorator is applied to them.  

Most decorators do change the decorated function. They usually do it by defining an inner function and returning it to replace the decorated function. Code that uses inner functions almost always depends on closures to operate correctly. To understand clo‐ sures, we need to take a step back a have a close look at how variable scopes work in Python.  

## Variable scope rules
## 变量域规则
In Example 7-4 we define and test a function which reads two variables: a local variable a, defined as function parameter, and variable b that is not defined anywhere in the function:  

在例子7-4中我们定义并测试了能够读取两个变量的函数：本地变量a定义为函数参数，变量b并没有定义函数中的任何地方：  

```python
Example 7-4. Function reading a local and a global variable.
>>> def f1(a): 
>>> ... print(a) 
>>> ... print(b)
>>> ...
>>> f1(3)
3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 3, in f1
NameError: global name 'b' is not defined
```

The error we got is not surprising. Continuing from Example 7-4, if we assign a value to a global b and then call f1, it works:  

碰到的这个错误并不令人惊讶。

```python
>>>b=6 
>>> f1(3)
>>>  3
6
```
Now, let’s see an example that may surprise you.  

现在，让我们看看可能让你感到惊喜的例子。  
Take a look at the f2 function in Example 7-5. Its first two lines are the same as f1 in Example 7-4, then it makes an assignment to b, and prints its value. But it fails at the second print, before the assignment is made:  

我们来看一看例子7-5中的函数f2.它的前两行和例子7－4中的相同，它对b进行赋值，并打印b的值。
*Example 7-5. Variable b is local, because it is assigned a value in the body of the func‐ tion.*  

```python
>>>b=6
>>> def f2(a): 
>>> ... 
>>> print(a) 
>>> ... 
>>> print(b)
>>>  ... 
>>> b=9
...
>>> f2(3)
3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 3, in f2
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'b' referenced before assignment
```


Note that the output starts with 3, which proves that the print(a) statement was executed. But the second one, print(b) never runs. When I first saw this I was surprised, thinking that 6 should be printed, because there is a global variable b and the assignment to the local b is made after print(b).  

注意输出是从3开始到，它证明了语句print(a)是可以执行的。但是在第二次，print(b)根本没有运行。
But the fact is, when Python compiles the body of the function, it decides that b is a local variable because it is assigned within the function. The generated bytecode reflects this decision and will try to fetch b from the local environment. Later, when the call f2(3) is made, the body of f2 fetches and prints the value of the local variable a, but when trying to fetch the value of local variable b it discovers that b is unbound.  

但事实情况是，当Python编译函数主体时将b判定为本地变量，因为b实在函数内部赋值的。
This is not a bug, but a design choice: Python does not require you to declare variables, but assumes that a variable assigned in the body of a function is local. This is much better than the behavior of JavaScript, which does not require variable declarations either, but if you do forget to declare that a variable is local (with var), you may clobber a global variable without knowing.  

这并不是一个bug，而是基于设计的考量：Python不会要求你申明变量，而是假定在函数主体赋值的变量为本地变量。
If we want the interpreter to treat b as a global variable in spite of the assignment within the function, we use the global declaration:  

```python
>>> def f3(a): 
>>> ... 
>>> global b 
>>> ... 
>>> print(a) 
>>> ... 
>>> print(b)
>>>  ... 
>>> b=9 
>>> ...
>>> f3(3) 3
6
>>> b
9
>>> f3(3)
a= 3
b= 8
b = 30 
>>> b
30 
>>>
```

After this closer look at how variable scopes work in Python, we can tackle closures in the next section, “Closures” on page 192. If you are curious about the bytecode differences between the functions in Example 7-4 and Example 7-5, see the following sidebar.  

>#### Comparing bytecodes
The dis module provides an easy way to disassemble the bytecode of Python functions. Read Example 7-6 and Example 7-7 to see the bytecodes for f1 and f2 from Example 7-4 and Example 7-5.  
>*Example 7-6. Disassembly of the f1 function from Example 7-4.* 

```python
>>> from dis import dis 
>>> dis(f1)

        0 LOAD_GLOBAL
        3 LOAD_FAST
        6 CALL_FUNCTION

```


>Load local name b. This shows that the compiler considers b a local variable, even if the assignment to b occurs later, because the nature of the variable — whether it is local or not — cannot change body of the function.  

>载入本地本地变量名b。这表示编译器把b当做一个本地变量，即便是对b的赋值发生在后面，因为这是变量的特点——不论变量是否为本地变量，都不可能改变函数的主体。

>The CPython VM that runs the bytecode is a stack machine, so the operations LOAD and POP refer to the stack. It is beyond the scope of this book to further describe the Python opcodes, but they are documented along with the dis module in dis — Disassembler for Python bytecode.  

>CPython虚拟机中运行字节代码的是栈机器，所以LOAD和POP操作都引用这个栈。

## Closures 闭包
In the blogosphere closures are sometimes confused with anonymous functions. The reason why many confuse them is historic: defining functions inside functions is not so common, until you start using anonymous functions. And closures only matter when you have nested functions. So a lot of people learn both concepts at the same time.  

在博客圈子里闭包有时候会和匿名函数搞混淆。人们会将它们之间弄混淆是有历史原因的：直到使用匿名函数之前，在函数内部定义函数不是件很普遍大事情。而闭包只关心你嵌套了什么函数。因此很多人在同一时间学习了这两个概念。  

Actually, a closure is function with an extended scope that encompasses non-global variables referenced in the body of the function but not defined there. It does not matter whether the function is anonymous or not, what matters is that it can access non-global variables that are defined outside of its body.  

实际上，闭包是一个
This is a challenging concept to grasp, and is better approached through an example.  

这对我们掌握概念来说是个挑战，而通过例子理解就是掌握它的好办法。  
Consider an avg function to compute the mean of an ever-increasing series of values, for example, the average closing price of a commodity over its entire history. Every day a new price is added, and the average is computed taking into account all prices so far.  

考虑一个用来计算不断增长的一系列值的avg函数，例如，商品历史周期内的平均收盘价。每天添加一个新的价格，
Starting with a clean slate, this is how avg could be used:  

透过清晰的均价列表，我们可以看到avg的用法：  

```python
>>> avg(10) 10.0
>>> avg(11) 10.5
>>> avg(12) 11.0
```

Where does avg come from, and where does it keep the history of previous values? For starters, Example 7-8 is a class-based implementation:  

avg从来得来的，它又是如何保存前面值的历史？先上道开胃小菜，例子7-8是一个基于类的实现：  
*Example 7-8. average_oo.py: A class to calculate a running average.*  

```python
class Averager():
	 def __init__(self):
	 	 self.series = []
	 def __call__(self, new_value): self.series.append(new_value) total = 	 	 sum(self.series) return total/len(self.series)
```

The Averager class creates instances that are callable:  

```python
>>> avg = Averager() >>> avg(10)
10.0
>>> avg(11)
10.5
>>> avg(12) 11.0
```
Now, Example 7-9 is a functional implementation, using a higher order function make_averager:  

*Example 7-9. average.py: a higher-order function to calculate a running average.*  

```python
def make_averager():  
	 series = []
	 
def averager(new_value): 
	 	 series.append(new_value) 
	 	 total = sum(series) 
	 	 return total/len(series)
	 return averager
```
When invoked, make_averager returns an averager function object. Each time an averager is called, it appends the passed argument to the series, and computes the current average:  

当调用make_averager函数时，返回的是averager函数对象。每次averager被调用时，它会将传递的参数追加到series，并计算当前的平均数。  
*Example 7-10. Testing Example 7-9*  

```python
>>> avg = make_averager() >>> avg(10)
10.0
>>> avg(11)
10.5
>>> avg(12) 11.0
```

Note the similarities of the examples: we call Averager() or make_averager() to get a callable object avg that will update the historical series and calculate the current mean. In Example 7-8, avg is an instance of Averager, and in Example 7-9 it is the inner function, averager. Either way, we just call avg(n) to include n in the series and get the updated mean.  

It’s obvious where the avg of the Averager class keeps the history: the self.series instance attribute. But where does the avg function in the second example find the series?  
Note that series is a local variable of make_averager because the initialization series = [] happens in the body of that function. But when avg(10) is called, make_averag er has already returned, its local scope is long gone.  

图片：略  

*Figure 7-1. The closure for averager extends the scope of that function to include the binding for the free variable series.*  

Within averager, series is a free variable. This is a technical term meaning a variable that is not bound in the local scope. See Figure 7-1.  

在averrager内部，series是一个`自由变量`。这是一个技术术语，它意味着变量没有绑定到本地变量域。见图表7-1.  
Inspecting the returned averager object shows how Python keeps the names of local and free variables in the `__code__` attribute that represents the compiled body of the function:  

*Example 7-11. Inspecting the function created by make_averager in Example 7-9.*  

```python
>>> avg.__code__.co_varnames ('new_value', 'total')
>>> avg.__code__.co_freevars ('series',)
```
