Chapter 19. Dynamic attributes and properties
*********************************************

```
The crucial importance of properties is that their existence makes it perfectly safe and indeed advisable for you to expose public data attributes as part of your class’s public interface[186].

— Alex Martelli Python contributor and book author
```  

Data attributes and methods are collectively known as attributes in Python: a method is just an attribute that is callable. Besides data attributes and methods, we can also create properties, which can be used to replace a public data attribute with accessor methods (i.e. getter/setter), without changing the class interface. This agrees with the Uniform access principle:  

```
All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation[187].
```  

Besides properties, Python provides a rich API for controlling attribute access and implementing dynamic attributes. The interpreter calls special methods such as `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` to evaluate attribute access using dot notation, eg. obj.attr. A user-defined class implementing `__getattr__` can implement “virtual attributes” by computing values on the fly whenever somebody tries to read a nonexistent attribute like obj.no_such_attribute.
